This repo contains code to train a Neural Network on the [American Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) on Kaggle.

The training notebook can be found in the **training** folder. There is also an [blog post here][] about how to train the model by me.

To run inference, use the **webcam_inference.py** file. Make you sure you replicate the virtual enviromnemt and install all requirements. Recommended way is to use conda. I provide the conda file requirements.txt for this purpose
